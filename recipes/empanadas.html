    <p>I'm showing you how to make what is one of the world's greatest meat-filled pastries. Or, it can be, if you avoid
        the three most common mistakes: empanadas that are under-seasoned, under-filled, and under-cooked. But, if you
        use the following technique, you'll avoid all of those issues, no matter what kind of filling you use!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <h4>For the Filling:</h4>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>

        <li>A half cup of diced poblano pepper</li>

        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <li>Half teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 and a half teaspoons ground dried chipotle pepper</li>

        <li>A half teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>A quarter teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>

        <li>3 cups diced cooked chicken</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>

        <li>2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>

        <li>A third of a cup of water</li>

        <li>3 quarters of a cup grated pepper Jack cheese (Optional)</li>

        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4>For the Dough:</h4>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 and a half teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>A third of a cup cold water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Pour olive oil into a saucepan; add onion, poblano, garlic, salt, pepper, chipotle, cumin, oregano, cayenne,
            and cooked chicken, pressing down as you go. Add currants.</li>
        <li>Place saucepan over high heat; cook until onions begin to soften slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in diced
            tomatoes with green chiles. Pour in 1/3 cup water and mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture to a simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquids are cooked
            down, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Chill
            thoroughly before use, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While filling simmers, combine flour, salt, and sugar for dough in a bowl with your hand. Grate in cold
            butter, pausing as needed to combine.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in beaten egg and water. Mix with a fork until it starts to form a shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Use your hands to squeeze mixture into a lump of dough; transfer to a work surface and knead into a ball of
            dough, 10 to 15 seconds. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unwrap chilled
            dough and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Use a bench scraper to divide into 8 equal pieces.
            Roll each piece into an 8-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Drain any excess juice from filling. Top each dough circle with a rounded 1/2-cup measure of the chicken
            mixture. Sprinkle some pepper Jack cheese over top.</li>
        <li>Brush edges of each dough circle with a small amount of water to dampen; fold over and seal with fingertips,
            making sure to not trap in any pockets of air. Crimp using your fingertips or a fork.</li>
        <li>Combine beaten egg and 2 teaspoons water for egg wash. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheet and
            brush over egg wash. Sprinkle with cayenne.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and crispy on the edges, about 35 minutes. Transfer
            to a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
